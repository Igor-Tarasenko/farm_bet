                        <p class="title">How do I place a bet?</p>
                        <p>First, login with your user ID and password and make sure you have enough funds in your
                            account. Competitions are divided into games (e.g. Counterstrike, Dota and LOL). Click the
                            game you&apos;re interested and select one or several bets from our line-up. Your bet will
                            appear in the bet slip on the right-hand side of the screen. Next, specify the amount you
                            wish to wager and your preferred category (single or multiple). When all of your selections
                            are made, click the &quot;bet&quot; button to place and confirm your bet.</p>

                        <p>Normally, the betting results are entered into the system within 30 minutes after the bets
                            are settled and credited to the winning accounts. Winning bets are displayed in green under
                            &quot;Bet History&quot; in your account.</p>

                        <p>We&apos;re working in settling the bets as fast as we can! In a perfect world you would have
                            your money instantly - we&apos;re working on getting there. In the meantime, please be

                        <p class="title">A bet-market disappeared/was locked on a game, why?</p>
                        <p>If a game is open for betting before it starts, and we don&apos;t offer live betting on that
                            particular game, then it will disappear. Another reason could be that an anomaly is found in
                            a game, or that other abnormal events has occured, which makes our traders lock it.</p>

                        <p class="title">What does multiple or combination bet mean?</p>
                        <p>Betting a multiple will multiply your odds, and possible winnings. To win your multiple bet,
                            all bets within the multiple must be right. You cannot bet on markets that depend on each
                            other, that would be cheating! Assume you place a multiple consisting of a bet on Fnatic to
                            win a game at the odds of 4.0, and another bet on NiP to win a game at the odds of 5.0. Your
                            multiple will have the odds of 4.0 x 5.0 = 20.0!</p>

                        <p class="title">What is a livebet?</p>
                        <p>Livebet means betting on an event which has already started, this means that you can place
                            your bets while the event is in progress. Login to your Betspawn account and click on the
                            tab &quot;live now&quot; and you´ll see the events that are active at the time. The betting
                            process is quite similar to regular betting, but keep in mind, there is always a small 5-10
                            second confirmation delay for livebets. Reason for that is to safeguard the product from
                            transmission delays and unwanted impacts during the game.</p>

                        <p>Yes, Betspawn´s win limit for a &quot;single&quot; bet is 2000 euros; Win limit for a &quot;combination/multiple&quot;
                            bet can reach up to 5000 euros. (Or equivalent amount in other currencies)</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, once you´ve confirmed your bet, it&apos;s not possible to cancel or edit it.
                            Always make sure that the details of your bet are correct before you confirm it.</p>

                        <p class="title">The game I bet on was cancelled or not played at all, what happens?</p>
                        <p>If you bet a single on the game, the bet will simply be voided, and you will get your money
                            within 24 hours, as we have to make absolutely sure the game was cancelled or postponed.</p>
                        <p>If your bet on the match was part of a multiple, the odds of the bet on that particular game
                            will be changed to 1, and the multiple will live on - it will not be lost. If a bet within
                            your multiple has been cancelled or postponed, the entire multiple will have to wait at
                            least 24 hours so that we can make sure the single bet has been cancelled or postponed.</p>

                        <p class="title">My bet was returned, why?</p>
                        <p>This could be because of various reasons. Most often, it is because the game was cancelled or
                            similarly changed. It could be that we by mistake kept the pre-match bet open, when the game
                            had already started. In this case, any bet made after the actual starting time has to be
                            voided. Another reason could be that the game has been postponed more than 24 hours, or that
                            it will be postponed or cancelled, and we can confirm this through an official source.</p>
