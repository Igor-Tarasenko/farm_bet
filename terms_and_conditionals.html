                        <p class="title">3. Glossary</p>
                        <p>3.1 Basic terms accepted in this edition of the rules: “Single” – a bet on a single
                            event;</p>
                        <p>“Combination” – this is a bet on the outcome of several different events simultaneously. When
                            you place a bet on the outcome of two or more events (for example, two different football
                            matches), you can unite them in “Combination”. To win a combination bet it is necessary for
                            you to not have any failed predictions (losses) on any of the outcomes which are included in
                            the Combination. Loss on one of the outcomes of a combination bet means loss throughout the
                            entire bet. Winnings of combination bets are equal to the product of the odds of the
                            different outcomes in the combination multiplied by the stake (if on one of the bets
                            included in the combination occurs a return, then the coefficient on it equals to 1).</p>
                        <p>“System” – a set of “combination bets” of a particular set of events. Each combination of the
                            system is calculated as a separate combination bet. To win in the system it is sufficient
                            that the indicated number of predictions of the total number be correct (it is defined by
                            name, that is, for example, in the system “3 of 4″ it is necessary that 3 of the 4
                            predictions prove correct, for “5 of 7″ it is necessary properly to predict the outcome of
                            the five events of 7 options, etc.). It must be taken into account that because of the fact
                            that only a part of the total bet amount is specified on each of the combination of the
                            system bet (proportional to the number of options) then the winnings by such a system bet
                            will be less than the possible general winnings by the combination bet. In some cases, when
                            not all outcomes are predicted, the amount of winnings may be less than the amount of the
                            bet, but in contrast, to combination bets, a part of the amount will be offset on account of
                            correctly predicted outcomes.</p>
                        <p>“Chain” – bet which is a combination of “single” bets including events independent from each
                            other. The sum of a single bet of chain ‘s each event is equal to the sum of chain. The
                            client is given a chance to determine independently the order of the bets included in the
                            chain and stake only on the first event of the chain. Thus, the concept of “chain account”
                            is imported. After the tournament of each single bet included in the chain the sum of that
                            account is calculated. Initially, it is equal to the sum of the first bet.</p>
                        <p>If the sum on the chain account is less than its initial sum, the chain’s next event’s single
                            bet is calculated by the account balance. The procedure of chain’s calculation depends on
                            the order of bets mentioned in the given ticket but not on time. The sum which remains on
                            the account after calculation of all bets in the chain is subject to payment. If the sum on
                            the chain account reaches zero – the chain breaks and is considered to be lost. “Handicap” –
                            the advantage or the leeway of the entrant of competition, expressed in maps, points, games,
                            etc., which is provided by Betspawn to the entrant with bets on it. The result of the event
                            subject to the handicap is determined in this way: the handicap given to the entrant is
                            added to the corresponding result shown by the entrant in the competition. If the results
                            thus obtained are in favor of the elected entrant, he is considered as a winner, and the
                            bets on his win subject to the handicap win. Payments are carried out with the coefficient
                            of winnings indicated in the description of bets. If the result is in favor of the opponent
                            – the bets are lost. If the result subject to the handicap is a draw, then the coefficient
                            of winnings under such a result will be equal to 1 (return of the bet);</p>

                            specified in the line of the current day may change after any bet, but conditions before
                            bets are the same, except in cases of technical and obvious mistakes in the line.</p>
                        <p>4.2 As an amount of bet, only the amount confirmed and registered by the Betspawn is
                            accepted.</p>
                        <p>4.3 The User is the only person who is responsible for the bet. Once a bet is made and its
                            acceptance is confirmed, it cannot be changed or canceled by the User. Betspawn does not
                            provide any guarantees with respect to the “lost” or “double” bets made by customers. Please
                            carefully check all the bets you have made.</p>
                        <p>4.4 Loss of your password cannot be a reason for the withdrawal rates or cancellation of the
                            request for payment of winnings.</p>
                        <p>4.5 A bet is accepted as soon as it is confirmed by Betspawn. All accepted bets are displayed
                            in the “Bet History”. In some cases, there may be a delay until a bet is listed in your
                            history. In case of any dispute, the time when the bet was registered in the system of
                            Betspawn is considered to be its true submission time. If the User did not receive any
                            notification about the acceptance of bet, the rate is still considered to be accepted if it
                            is displayed in the “Bet History.”</p>
                        <p>4.6 Failures of communication or other technical failures in customer communications are not
                            a reason for the cancellation of a bet if the bet has been registered in the server.</p>

                        <p>5.2 Betspawn makes every effort to make the information on Live events (such as results, the
                            time of a game and the statistics of teams /players) be correct. However, this information
                            is displayed only for informational purposes. Betspawn is not responsible in case of any

                            uniquely have not been indicated, all bets are refundable.</p>

                            indicated in the line incorrectly (except for errors in translation), that is if the other
                            team/entrant of represented tournament is indicated instead of the necessary one, all the
                            bets on that event are recognized as invalid and a return is made. Only Betspawn has the
                            right to determine the events belonging to this category.</p>
                        <p>5.6 In cases when the specific details of the team such as a particular age group (for
                            example 18 years/to 21 years/youth teams), gender (women) or the status of the team
                            (reserve) are not indicated in the line resulting in the marking of the other team in the
                            line instead of the declared one, all bets on this match are refundable. In other cases,
                            when an incomplete name or possible grammar errors are indicated in the line, all bets
                            remain in force. If the gender of teams is not indicated on the line, it is considered that
                            the gender of teams is male. In case women’s teams are participating in a match it is
                            necessary to have a detailed indication about it in the line otherwise bets on this match
                            are subject to a return.</p>
